Adding a theme to the list
Create your theme using hugo new theme THEMENAME;
Test your theme against https://github.com/spf13/HugoBasicExample;
Add a theme.toml file to the root of the theme;
Add a README.md to the root of the theme;
Add /images/screenshot.png and /images/tn.png;
Open up a new Issue with a link to the theme's repository on GitHub.
If your theme doesn't fit into the Hugo Basic Example site, we encourage theme authors to supply a self-contained Hugo site in /exampleSite. NOTE: The folder name here is important, as this folder will be picked up and used by the script that generates the Hugo Theme Site. See Artist theme's exampleSite for a good example. And please make the site's content as neutral as possible.
